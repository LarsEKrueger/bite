//! Provide a rate-limited polling mechanism.
//!
//! Assumes that if one event has been processed, another one will follow immediately. If no event
//! was obtained during that polling cycle, wait for a predetermined time to try again. This
//! ensures that events that come in quick succession can be processed at maximum speed (one per
//! cycle), but the CPU doesn't have to spin at 100% to do the polling.
//!
//! # Errors
//!
//! If the polling reads from a limited buffer and that fills up (e.g. due to a too long polling
//! cycle), the sender might block.
